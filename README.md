Welcome to my LangChain Exploration repository! This project contains two Jupyter Notebooks that showcase the power of LangChain, HuggingFace models, and conversational AI for natural language processing tasks.

What's Inside?
Langchain1.ipynb: A simple demo of text generation using the GPT-2 model from HuggingFace. It generates a response to the question, "What is the future of AI?" using the transformers library.
Langchain2.ipynb: A deep dive into LangChain's capabilities, including:
Text generation with google/flan-t5-large via HuggingFace.
Fetching and simplifying Wikipedia summaries (e.g., on AI) for a younger audience.
Building conversational AI with memory, prompt templates, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Using embeddings and FAISS for document search, plus agent-based workflows with custom tools.
Why This Project?
I created this to experiment with LangChain and HuggingFace for building AI-powered applications. Whether you're interested in text generation, conversational AI, or document retrieval, these notebooks provide practical examples to get you started.
